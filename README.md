<h1 align="center"> EasyBot </h1>


# Description
This is my own project, which I did about 2 years ( with breaks ).

My goal was to make this bot work on every OTS, what I was able to achieve.

The bot works externally, and its behavior is not completely predicted. There are randomized times, values, behaviors, etc..

It is possible to operate on a minimized window. We can do different things in between and it doesn't interfere with bot.

We can use the bot on multiple clients at once, and we don't have to worry about CPU or RAM consumption, as it is small.

The bot works by reading the RAM addresses of a process and based on the current state of the game image.

I leave the bot open source, I consider the project finished, most of it works, and if not you can boldly change it !

If you liked it or learned something from this project, please leave a star :star:
